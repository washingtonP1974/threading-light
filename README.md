# thread =  a flow of execution. Like a separate order of instructions.
#                  However each thread takes a turn running to achieve concurrency
#                  GIL = (global interpreter lock),
#                  allows only one thread to hold the control of the Python interpreter at any one time

# cpu bound = program/task spends most of it's time waiting for internal events (CPU intensive)
#             use multiprocessing

# io bound = program/task spends most of it's time waiting for external events (user input, web scraping)
#            use multithreadin
